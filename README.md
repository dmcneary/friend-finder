# Friend Finder 

### A personality matching app featuring MySQL, express, and node

Friend Finder collects users, their pictures, and scores based on a survey. The scores are compared and the surveyee is given a closest match from the collection of users.

Currently users are stored locally, but the app could be easily scaled to an external database.

This app was built as an exercise in using a custom front-end with node.js, express.js, and MySQL as a database on the backend.
